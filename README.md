# Visual Studio For Mac Code Snippets #

This is simply personal collection of custom snippets I have created to make my life a little bit easier.

### Where To Stick These On Your Mac
I have yet to find a way to change the path of where custom snippets are stored, and the path used by default appears dependent on the *version* of Visual Studio you are using. It is possible that this path may not be exactly the same on your Mac, but it should be something like: 

__~/Library/VisualStudio/8.0/Snippets__

## ToDo:
* Wouldn't it be cool to have a little shell script in this repo that would automatically copy these snippets into the current location where VS4Mac looks for them (eg, "~/Library/VisualStudio/8.0/Snippets as of 2020.01.15)? Yup. That'd be cool.
